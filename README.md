The difference between list and tuple is, list is mutable but tuple is not that is no modify operation can be applied
on tuple.
So tuple can be used as a key for the map but list can not be used.
Immutability is the property of tuple.
In tuple order of insertion is preserved.

Sets doesn't contain duplicates and sets are mutable but frozen sets are immutable that is it can be read only, no modifications are allowed.
